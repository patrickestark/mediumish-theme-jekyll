I am a converted educator. Let me explain. I retired from the Navy at 20.5 years and went into education as a Math teacher. Then after four years of that I got promoted to Assistant Principal. I did that for 15 years, 13 of those year were at the high school level. I then was very fortunate enough to interview for a technology department in the same district. I have always been a tech geek. I got the job and now 'I am living the dream', never said that before.
