### This website is built using Jekyll ###

I am a converted educator. Let me explain. I retired from the Navy at 20.5 years and went into education as a Math teacher. Then after four years of that I got promoted to Assistant Principal. I did that for 15 years, 13 of those years were at the high school level. I then was very fortunate enough to interview for a technology position in the same district. I have always been a tech geek. I got the job and now 'I am living the dream', never said that before. 

I want this site to be where I express different things going on in my life. So you will see articles of my family, things that are going on with us and my hobbies, plus just different stuff to **RAMBLE** on about. Hope you like it.
