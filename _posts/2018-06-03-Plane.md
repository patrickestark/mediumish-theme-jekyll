Among many of my hobbies Flying is one that I really like and able to participate in other ways. One of those is being able to modify the planes that I fly. You can even build your own plane. Have not done that yet. But I did take a plane the Cessna 172SP and painted it to use for CCISD. I am eventually going to build an airport and use that as homebase for the Corpus Chrisit ISD (CCISD) plane. X-plane is a flying simulator that even the professional pilots use. There are many people that build planes and airports for the simulator. I am slowly working on building an airport but it is slow porgress only because I have to many other hobbies. This hobby is very detailed so you have to put the time in get any progress done. Anyway I will eventually post everything here when I am done. I will probably post updates once in awhile. ***Happy Flying***
