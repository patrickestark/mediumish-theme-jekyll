So the other day my wife and I walked into J.C.Penny to look for some clothing that I needed. As I walked in I looked over to my right and saw that the fitting room for men was closed and out of order. I stopped an employee and asked if there was a place I could try on some pants since this was closed. The employee pointed down toward the end of the store and said that there was a fitting room in the youth area, (yeah, right I am going to use that). After that we walked over to the left and this is what we saw.
