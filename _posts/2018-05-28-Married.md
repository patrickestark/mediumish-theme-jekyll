On April 5, 2018 our daughter Jennifer got married to her soulmate. It was a really nice wedding. The venue was spectacular. We were also graced with my wife's sister from Pennslyvania as well as Nunzia's niece. Some friends and family of Alfie came from out of state also. We had a great rehearsal dinner at a Mexican Restaurant, it was well worth it. We had a father and daughter dance and that was something I will cherish the rest of my life. Jennifer is real lucky to meet such a great and intelligent guy but that is to be expected from Jennifer. She does not settle for stupidty and someone that does not have initative. Anyway we are very happy to see that she is happy.
