This was Texas Dungeon Crawler Group 1 second game. This game was more detailed so I was using the recording of the game to help me with some of the parts that I missed. But the audio part of the recording did not work completely throughout the whole game. There are a lot of areas that the audio did not record. It took me awhile to figure out what happened. I think I figured out a better way. I am going to try a different way next game. I am going to add a section of the game to a youtube channel. There is a section that the audio did work. 


So now the DM is telling us that we see a Goblin run off down a trial injured leaving a trial of blood. Nighscar says we need to be careful following to closely so he does not lead us to a trap. DM says we catch the Goblin and he is dying. Nighscar says he is trying to get information but DM says he speaks Goblin and we don’t understand. So Elemendorf says lets take him prisoner. So we tie him up to our wagon. DM says the trail goes up Northish. Nighscar asked for a map. DM says “nope”. 

08:16, DM says the path is narrow and will only allow passage in single file. So we are setting up our formation:
Nightscar, Darra, Brinklehoff, Elemendorf and KenKann. 

08:20 DM asked Nighscar for a Perception check. Rolled a 19-1 = 18. DM says while walking down the trail you noticed a little heap of dirt. Nightscar thinks it is trap. Brinklehoff asked if a survival check be used and the DM says you can walk up to it. DM says it is a snare trap after Brinklehoff looked at it. Nightscar says we are going to go around it. 

GM says about 10 minutes into the path is when we saw the snare trap. Had to do another perception check. Rolled 11-1=10. Had to do a Dexterity check 4-1=3. I went into a trap and lost 3 HP. Brinklehoff has night vision and asked if he can look down to see how deep it is. GM says it is not deep and has no spikes, so I was able jump out. GM says we see a clearing up ahead.
