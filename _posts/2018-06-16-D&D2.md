***Texas Dungeon Crawlers***

***This our 2nd Game that we played on Saturday morning June 16, 2018.***

***Main Characters:*** Nightscar (Dragonborn Paladin), Darra Lighttouch (Halfing Cleric), KenKann Kilallott (Half Orc Fighter), Elmendorf (Half Elf Wizard), Brinklehoff (Gnome Bard)

***Dungeon Master*** = "Weighted Dice"

This was Texas Dungeon Crawler Group 1 second game. This game was more detailed so I was using the recording of the game to help me with some of the parts that I missed. But the audio part of the recording did not work completely throughout the whole game. There are a lot of areas that the audio did not record. It took me awhile to figure out what happened. I think I figured out a better way. I am going to try a different way next game. I am going to add a section of the game to a youtube channel. There is a section that the audio did work.
