So Real Madrid did it again and won another Champions League Title. That is three in a row. The only other team to do this was Bayern Munich (my team by the way) back in 1974, 1975, 1976. I was really hoping that Liverpool was going to win. But after Sergio Ramos (who I really dislike) took Salah down in a arm bar while both were going for the ball took their most powerful weapon out of the fight. Salah had to leave because his shoulder was messed up and he could not play without being in pain. Then Gareth Bale came in to the game at around 62 minutes. I told my wife and son that he is very dangerous that Liverpool needs to be careful of him. At right around 63 minutes Marcello sends a beautiful pass to Bale and Bale does a Pele kick and sends it in. Bale ends up scoring twice. Before that Liverpools goalie has lapse of reasoning and casually starts to throw the ball to one of his players when Benzema who is standing in front of him just throws out his left leg, he deflects the ball and it just rolls into the net. Bales second shot is made from at least 25 yards away, the goalie trys to catch it but it goes right through his hands like he was throwing into the net. Real won 3-1. Liverpook just could not handle them. AND yes, I still think Sergio took out Salah on purpose. My son did remind me that when Salah played for Roma that he played the same way, trying to hurt people, so maybe this was just Karma at the wrong time.
