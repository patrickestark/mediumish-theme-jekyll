Today Saturday June 2, 2018 is our first official game. We had some technical difficulties but that is to be expected when working with a new program. Some characters (who we won't mention here :)) was having problems importing their character. We finally got started at 08:40. The Dungeon Master starts out by telling us we are in the city of Neverwinter. We are in a Pub where Brinklehoff is meeting with an old friend. So Nightscar buys Brinklehoff and his friend a drink (This cost me 7 silver), and interrupts the conversation to ask if he can join the adventure that is spoken about between Brinklehoff and his friend. 08:55 we are in town buying inventory. Darra Light recommended that we buy a Healer's kit, which we did and put in the Inventory, had to deduct 5 gold from my inventory for that. 09:58 the DM put up a map of Neverwinter. 09:03 DM circled Neverwinter on the map. Darra Light is having problems hearing the DM, his voice keeps cutting out. At 09:14 the DM told us that we were travelling from Neverwinter travelling South on "The High Road." We are in a caravan being led by Oxens. So DM asked us our marching order. I told him I wanted to be in front of the Caravan, the oxens like I am guarding the caravan. He agreed since the oxens move slow. So we now have our formation set. We are waiting on Darra (Billy) to get back. She was having problems hearing the DM.
