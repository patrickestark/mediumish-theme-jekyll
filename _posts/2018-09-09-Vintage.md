Well, so I have been perusing EBAY, which I have not done in awhile. I am a watch freak but just recently decided to start collecting Timex watches which is the brand I grew up with in the 60's and 70's. Not to say I am not going to collect other brands. Just decided to start on this brand. So the first two that have been delivered to me this week are pictured below.
