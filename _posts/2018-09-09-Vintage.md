Well, so I have been perusing EBAY, which I have not done in awhile. I am a watch freak but just recently decided to start collecting Timex watches which is the brand I grew up with in the 60's and 70's. Not to say I am not going to collect other brands. Just decided to start on this brand. I won three bids, two have been delivered.

This first one is 1965 Timex 21 Jewel automatic watch that is ticking off and on.

So I will have to go in and look at the movement and see what is wrong. Of course I will be taking my time because I am still learning but lucky enough to have great videos and a forum I frequent for help. This is what the movment looks like:

So now I just need to research and see what movement is in this watch. I have service manuals from the 60' and 70's that someone uploaded to the forum so that is a great resource. 

Of course I am going to clean the crystal and give the watch an upgrade with a black leather watchband. 

Now the second watch

This one is really intriguing and I was happy that I won the bid. This watch did not cost me more than $24.00 with delivery. I was intrigued with it being an electric watch and having "West Germany" stamped on the front of the dial. The owner was not sure of the year. So I am hoping to find out when I get inside the watch. But I have to get a crystal remover because you have to take that off first to be able to get into the watch. This what the back of the watch looks like:

So you can see where the battery goes. The dial right below to the side is the crown. Luckily the crystal removers are cheap to buy. I want to get this one cleaned up and put on a new leather watchband also. So we shall see. It will take time because I have a lot to learn. 

When these two are complete I will tackle my wife's watch her grandfather use to wear. It is a 1975 Timex and she would like to get it working again. I am going to fix it and put on a nice black leather watchband. I will post pictures of it before and after when I start fixing it. 

Well that is it for now. Stay tuned. KEEP ON TICKING!
