Well, so I have been perusing EBAY, which I have not done in awhile. I am a watch freak but just recently decided to start collecting Timex watches which is the brand I grew up with in the 60's and 70's. Not to say I am not going to collect other brands. Just decided to start on this brand. So the first two that have been delivered to me this week are pictured below.

The first one is 1965 Timex 21 Jewel automatic watch that was ticking away off and on. So will have to go in and look at the movement and see what is wrong. Of course I will be taking my time because I am still learning but lucky enough to have great vidoes and a forum I frequent for help. This is what the movment looks like:
