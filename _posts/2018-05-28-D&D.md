Saturday night we started a Dungeon and Dragon game online. The group consisted of John (as Dungeon Master), Billy (as Darra), Jennifer (as Elmendorf), Alfie (as Brinklehoff), Billy Jr. (as KenKann), Chris (as Duratan), and me (as NightScar). We all played this from the comfort of our home using a program called Fantasy Grounds, Roll20 for sound effects and Discord to speak with each other. This program lets us play a paper and pencil game online. The program automates most of the work, such as scoring and putting the character sheet online. it was a lot of fun being able to play with everyone. We started about 9:00 pm and did not finish until 1:00 am. It was a long game that took us through only two rooms. But many of the game playing was all of us learning how the system worked and learning all the intricities of the game. John the Dungeon Master did a fantastic job of keeping us on track, interested and answering questions as well as admitting at times that he was still learning the system. He would give us the advantage if he was not sure of something until he was able to research it. It was really nice to play with family (Brinlehoff and Elmendorf) and I did miss playing console or any games with Billy and John so that is an added benefit. Both Billy and John are old masters at D&D so it is nice to hear the conversations and learn from them. Next week we start our first official game where we will be able to level up as we go. There are enough people interested in the game right now that we have to break up into two groups. Kirby and Timberwolf and Chris will go to the other group. This will add more time on John the DM because he will have to run two groups at seperate times but he loves playing the game so that helps. I am anticipating the next game, it is addictive but not to the point it would ruin my life. I remember in the early 80's overseas we had a sailor that committed suicide and they blamed it on D&D, but obviously he already had problems. Anyway cannot wait until the next game. **KEEP THE GEEK ON!**
