I have been interested more and more the watches that celebrites and people in great power wear. One person who is arguably a person of much power and wealth that stands out is Vladimir Putin, President of Russia. One of his famous quotes, "The path towards a free society has not been simple. There are tragic and glorious pages in our history." Well, yes, I would agree with that Quote, LOL. Anyway I transgressed.

One person Teddy Baldassarre did a YouTube presentation on September 1, 2018 of Prominent Figures and the watches they wear. The one that Putin wears the most is a limited A.Lange & SÃ–hne which only 50 pieces were made at a retail price of $507,792, yes, you read that right.
