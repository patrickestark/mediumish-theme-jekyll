This watch is truly a beauty, the Grand Seiko "Snowflake", which is referenced as SBGA011. Featuring a spring drive movement (calibre 9R65) that makes the second hand sweep as smooth as an electronic clock. If you look closely at the dial face you will see that is looks like snowflakes dotting the dial. If you look at 8:00 that is the power reserve (RÃ¨serve de Marche) it is a complication of the watch, which is designed to show the amount of *remaining* stored energy.

This is a must have in the watch collection but of course that will take awhile since a new one runs anywhere from $6000-$7200. But this will be a nice watch to have beside the Rolex that I will buy myself when I retire. It is to be expected that Seiko have so many beautiful watches considering they were the one that introduced the first Quartz watch. On December 25, 1969, in Tokyo, Seiko introduced the Astron, the world's first quartz wristwatch. It was a limited editon of 100 gold-case watches, priced at 450,000 Yen the equivalent then to the cost of a Toyota Corolla, (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-16/a-concise-history-of-the-quartz-watch-revolution).

So if anyone wants to buy me a Grand Seiko "Snowflake" I won't turn it down. **KEEP ON TICKING**!
