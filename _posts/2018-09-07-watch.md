I have always been a watch freak but just recently started getting interested in repairing them as well as collecting them. The featured image is a Mathey-Tissot I just bought this month. I really like the contrast of the black face against the brown watch band. My wife has a old 1974 Timex Mercury that was her grandfathers. It is not in the best shape so I am going to try and repair it and get it running. Brand new they look like this:

The past week I have won three bids on EBAY for TIMEX watches. One was a 1968 and the other two around that same time period. After they come in I will post pictures. I want to clean them up and do maintenance on them to get them working the best as we can. I was lucky enough to get the service manuals from a watch forum that someone posted. Anyway, KEEP ON TICKING!
