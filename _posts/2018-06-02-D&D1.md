***Dungeon Master*** = "Weighted Dice"

Today Saturday June 2, 2018 is our first official game. We had some technical difficulties but that is to be expected when working with a new program. Some characters (who we won't mention here :)) was having problems importing their character. We finally got started at 08:40. The Dungeon Master starts out by telling us we are in the city of Neverwinter. We are in a Pub where Brinklehoff is meeting with an old friend. So Nightscar buys Brinklehoff and his friend a drink (This cost me 7 silver), and interrupts the conversation to ask if he can join the adventure that is spoken about between Brinklehoff and his friend. 08:55 we are in town buying inventory. Darra Lighttouch recommended that we buy a Healer's kit, which we did and put in the Inventory, had to deduct 5 gold from my inventory for that (should of asked Darra for the gold). 08:58 the DM put up a map of Neverwinter. 09:03 DM circled Neverwinter on the map. Darra Lighttouch is having problems hearing the DM, DM's voice keeps cutting out. At 09:14 the DM told us that we were travelling from Neverwinter travelling South on "The High Road." We are in a caravan being led by Oxens. So DM asked us our marching order. I told him I wanted to be in front of the Caravan by the oxens like I am guarding the caravan. He agreed since the oxens move slow. So we now have our formation set. We are waiting on Darra (Billy) to get back. Darra was having problems hearing the DM.

09:26 Darra asked if in the distance if it was clear or a forest. DM told him that it was clear and then he explained the formation that we were put in while he was away getting his laptop relocated. DM says we have been traveling for two(2) days so we have to take two days of ration off our inventory sheet. So now I am down to eight(8) of rations. At 09:45 we started back on the adventure. There are two horses down in front of us on the path. Nightscar and KenKann go up to inspect. There are black arrows in the horses. The saddlebags are empty and the mapcase is empty. 09:51 four (4) goblins come out of the forest and then disappears but the they are back now. KenKann and Nightscar can see them but the rest of the party cannot see them yet. We are going to roll and see if we get surprised. So KenKann rolled an 18-1 for perception. Nightscar rolled a 1-1 for his perception. So now the Goblins get a free attack on us. We all had to roll initiative and we all rolled low. So the Goblins will get one free attack on KenKann and Nightscar.

10:04 we are finally in combat. Goblin1 is getting a free attack on KenKann. So KenKann is already wounded. Now Goblin2 is attacking Nightscar. Goblin2 misses Nightscar. Goblin3 fires his bow at Nightscar. It is a hit, and Nightscar is wounded. Goblin4 is firing at KenKann with his short bow, it is an automatic miss. So now the goblins are rolling for initiative. Now we are starting our combat order starting with Brinklehoff. He moves diagonally behind KenKann and is using a debuff on all the Goblins. Only one of the Goblins succeeded against the debuff. DM decided that one minute is four rounds. When Goblins roll they have to roll a D4 and subtract their attack modifier. Darra attacked with Sacred Flame at Goblin1, but Goblin1 succeeded and is saved. KenKann killed Goblin1 with a Damage of 8. Now Elmendorf is moving her character right in front of KenKann and next to Nightscar. She is attacking Goblin2 with Chill Touch but missed. So now Goblin2 is attacking Nightscar, he hit Nightscar but had to roll a d4 found the number and had to put in a -2 modifier so he missed Nightscar. Goblin3 is attacking Nightscar he moved South and is right in front of me. He hit me with a damage of six and now I am wounded heavy. Goblin4 is attacking Elmendorf but missed. Nightscar attacked Goblin 2 and did an automatic miss.

It is now Brinklehoff's turn. He is attacking Goblin2, he cast Vicious Mockery. Goblin2 save throw failed against Brinklehoff. Goblin2 is wounded. Goblin2 takes disadvantage and is debuffed. Now it is Darra's turn. Darra moves right behind Nightscar, she is going to target Goblin3 with a sacred flame but Goblin3 has a saving roll. So now KenKann's turn, he moves on the right side of Goblin4 and takes his turn. He uses Battleaxe and misses. Now it is Elmendorf, she is going to use the Ray of Frost, range 60', it is a beam of blue light. Targeting Goblin2, attack is missed. Goblin2 attacks Nightscar with a disadvantage. It is a miss. DM clicked on -2 and disadvantage and the system figured it out and recorded a miss. Now Goblin3 is up and targets Elmendorf. Goblin3 does not like the stuff coming out of Elmendorf's hands. Elmendorf is now dying. Goblin4 is next. Goblin4 is going to disengage and move back and change weapons. Goblin4 is done. Nightscar attacks Goblin2 but misses. Brinklehoff is next and targets Goblin2 with vicious mockery and gives 1 damage. Now it is Darra's turn, she is targeting Goblin3 and using scared flame, Goblin3 fails and gets Heavy damage, and as a bonus action he gives healing word to Elmendorf and she gets healed, she gets five (5) heal points back. KenKann is next, and he is moving diagonally up to Goblin3. He attacks Goblin3 and swings with battleaxe and misses. KenKann says he is changing his name to mis-alot Elmendorf is going to use her Missiles and DM says she has to designate where all three missles is going. Goblin3 is getting one, and Goblin4 is getting 2. Goblin3 is dying. Goblin4 is getting two hits and it is wounded and now dying. Now it is Goblin2 turn. Goblin2 attacks Nightscar and misses. Nightscar attacks Goblin 2 and misses. Brinklehoff cast Vicious Mockery and Gobin2 made the save. Darra moves over behind Goblin2 and targets Goblin2 (which is the only left), she uses a mace and misses. 
Now KenKann takes his turn, he moves up to Goblin2 and swings his Battleaxe and hits and is wounded, DM says that he is down and bleeding very bad, he drops his sword and says something that no one understands. Darra pokes him and DM says he is dead.

Darra wants to loot him. Now the DM had us roll for Perception, KenKann hears rustling in the bushes and sees a Weak looking Goblin run down a trail heading North. We are stopping here and DM is going to issue out XP. Darra asked if we are able to check for loot now our when we come back. DM said no one had asked to loot and we all said Darra did. So DM said, "You did not find anything." LOL. DM says we have our XP. We ended at 11:05. ***GET YOUR GEEK ON***
