This Seiko Astron GPS Solar is an upgrade from the first one in 2015. It is thinner, smaller and consumes less energy. The cover image is a Seiko Astron GPS Solar 5x series SSH003. This watch connects twice a day to a satellite network, by two different sensors. One sensor is set off by the Sun and the other one is set by the owner. This watch does not need a battery because it runs off of solar power. This watch has a second timezone feature. At the 6 o'clock position is the home time, the 9 o'clock subdial shows a selector and the subdial at 3 o'clock is the day indicator. As you can see there is a PM and AM subdial right below the 3 o'clock subdial. Seiko put the date indicator at the 4:30 position. 

The watch has a Titanium bracelet that is light weight and has a neat feature at the clasp. You can adjust the clasp by pushing in some very small buttons and slide the clasp in or out to adjust the tightness. This watch will be available in December of this year 2018 and it looks like it is priced at about â‚¬2200. **KEEP ON TICKING**
