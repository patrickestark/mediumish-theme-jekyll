I married my wife in Italy many years ago. I always knew she was very intelligent woman just by watching and listening to her speak Italian in such an articulate way. Well, many years later she not only speaks English very well but is now a writer for Thrive Global. That is really an amazing feat to go from not speaking English to writing it for an online publication.

This is her lastest article.
